> ⚠️ Surgeon General's Warning: More than 1 hour of Rust without breaks may cause drowsiness, hallucinations, or spontaneous trait bounds.

We’ll aim to take a short break at the top of each hour — it helps you focus and absorb the material.

Lunch is at noon.

## Questions

**Please ask questions.** That’s what I’m here for!

If you’re attending remotely, feel free to post your question and ask someone in the room to flag me down.

## Workshop Tasks

You’ll find a mix of short (and not-so-short) workshop items throughout the three days.  
Please work together in your pods, and let me know if you get stuck — or **when you're done**. It’s easy to miss a quiet “we finished” signal from the front of the room.

This isn’t high school — I don’t mind if you look up the answers, Google it, ask ChatGPT, or search the repo.  
What matters is that *you’re learning* — so use whatever tools help you understand best.
