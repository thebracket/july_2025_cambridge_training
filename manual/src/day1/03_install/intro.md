# Installing Rust

> Note: Having Rust and a working text-editor on your laptop was listed as a pre-requisite. If you're having troubles, I'll try and help you at the break.

You should have Rust installed on your computer. Ideally, you downloaded it from [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs). You *can* install it via `apt-get` or similar tools---but you often wind up with an out-of-date version, or discover oddities.
