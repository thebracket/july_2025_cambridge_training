# No Editor Wars

I once made the mistake of including a section in a book draft about setting up Visual Studio Code. My tech reviewers sent more comments on this than any other part of the book. I definitely don't want to rekindle any Vi, Emacs, Helix, Zed, Notepad++, etc. holy wars!

Use an editor with which you are comfortable. Ideally one that supports LSP and Rust Analyzer (it will make your life easier).

Also: JetBrains keep giving me free stuff. I often teach in RustRover because I like it. However, it's not free. The debugger is really nice, and I like the way it feels - but use what works for you.
