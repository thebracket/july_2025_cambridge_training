# Setting up Visual Studio Code

I know I just said I wouldn't start any editor wars - but if you *are* using Visual Studio Code, make sure you install the Rust Analyzer extension. It gives you all the features you need: smart expansions, refactorings, macro expansion, etc.

The official guide is here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)

## Other Useful Extensions

* `CodeLLDB` - Optional, but can make debugging in VSCode easier.
* `Even Better TOML` - Rust uses lots of TOML for configuration.

## Setting Up NeoVim

I’ll admit it — I don’t use Emacs.

But if you're a `nvim` user, this guide comes highly recommended for a great Rust experience:
