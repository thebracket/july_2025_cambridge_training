# Cargo

Rust packages code together in `crates`. A crate can be an executable, a library or both. Managing lots of crates requires `Cargo`!

Cargo is a bit of a swiss-army knife. Cargo can:

* Create new projects.
* Manage dependencies.
* Manage your build in a consistent fashion.
* Install new plugins to Cargo itself.
* Install programs on your computer.
* Publish crates to `crates.io`
* Build your documentation
* And probably bake your dinner

We aren't going to do a deep-dive into every nook and cranny of Cargo. We'd be here all week, and wouldn't have written anything useful!
