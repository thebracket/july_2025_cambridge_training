# Thank you!

Thank you for having me! I hope today was informative and you learned something new about Rust. You've come a long way in a day: you've created libraries, CLI tools, serialized/deserialized data and built a mini adventure game with rooms and exits.

Let's go over any questions.

See you tomorrow! We'll be diving into logging, traits, error handling, generics, testing, pointers, and concurrency. It's going to be a packed day!
