# Workshop: Improvements

So there's a lot of room to improve! Here are some ideas:

* Not sending passwords in plain text would be a good idea!
* Add a counter or semaphore to limit the number of concurrent players and avoid DoS attacks.
* Add a dashboard/console to the server to see who is connected, what rooms exist, etc.
* Add inter-player messaging (e.g. "say hello" command).
* Add items, NPCs, and other game mechanics.

Any suggestions?
